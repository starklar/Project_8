To run, open Cloud CLI (or connecting to Azure through your own terminal should work) and either copy paste
the commands from or upload and run the project_setup.sh file.

Note that you may want to change some of the variables values before you run (ex. $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME)
so that people do not get confused if people happen to be working at the same time.

Try to keep variables at the top of the file. And also please make new ones as they come up.
